# Guessing-a-Number-game
A Python Project which is a game of Guessing the number.
In this I have used the import module to generate a number within the noundaries given by user.
Used Error and Exception Handling concepts to give hints to the user,whether the number the user entered is valid or not or greater than the key or less than the key
The User will also know the attempt number before he/she attempt everytime
After a Successful guess the user will get the total number attempts he made to guess
There is a choice also for the user to get all the attempts he made to be visible after the game ends.
